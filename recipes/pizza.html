                <li>Mix the warm water, yeast and granulated sugar in a bowl, and let it sit in a bowl. Allow it to rest in a bowl for 5 mins, and after mix
                    the dough with a wooden spoon</li>
                <li>Add the olive oil, salt and flour, and let it beat for 2 minutes</li>
                <li>Keep mixing the dough for 5 additional minutes, if the dough becomes too sticky, you can sprinkle some flour,
                    after kneading the dough should become soft, poke it with a toothpick and if it rises slowly, it should be ready.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil, and place the dough in the bowl.<strong>Cover it with something and let it rise for about 60-90 minutes.</strong></li>
