            <li><strong>Preparing the Dough -</strong> Whisk the warm milk, yeast and a tablespoon of sugar togheter. Cover and allow it to sit for 5-10 minute, until foamy</li>
            <li>Add the remaining sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, nutmeg, salt and about 250g of flour, beat on low speed for a minute. After add the remaining
                flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes togheter</li>
            <li><strong>Knead the Dough -</strong>Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5-7 full minutes. After kneading, the dough should be

            turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is about 1.5cm thick. Now using a doughnut cutter, cut it
            into doughnuts.</li>
            <li>After line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, and place the dougnuts. Make sure to cover them and leave them there for about 30 minutes
                as you heat the oil.(They should rise abit as they are resting)</li>
            <li><strong>Preparing Oil -</strong>Pour Oil into a large, heavy duty pot fitted with an oil thermometer. Turn the stove on to medium heat,
            and heat the oil until 200Â°C</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking the Doughnuts -</strong>Add about 2-3 doughnuts at a time and cook for one minute on each side, repeat this with all the doughnuts</li>
            <li><strong>Preparing the Glaze-</strong>Whisk all the glaze Ingredients togheter, and dip each<strong>WARM</strong>doughnut into the glaze, make sure
            to glaze all the sides, after around 20 minutes the glaze should set.</li>
